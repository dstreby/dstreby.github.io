Superfuntime adventures in code, engineering, cats, and anything else I find myself doing to maintain a semblance of sanity.

This blog is intended, more than anything else, to serve as a place for organizing my thoughts, documenting issues, and keeping track of projects.

I have little to no expectation that anyone will really read this. If by some stroke of (bad) luck youâ€™ve found yourself here, please feel free to ask questions, make comments, or berate me.

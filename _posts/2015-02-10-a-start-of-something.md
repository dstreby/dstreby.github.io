So blogs. Those are a thing.

In an effort to keep myself, particularly some of my projects, a bit more organized, I've jumped on
the blog bandwagon (is it still a bandwagon? do people still do this?). I don't expect to post
here with any regularity, nor do I expect anything I post to have any great value to anyone -  or even 
for anyone to read it for that matter! That said, if you've found yourself here and you actually get
something out of it, then that's awesome; I've accomplished more than I set out to do.

Anyway, I'm far from a writer, so I'm not going to drag this out any longer. With any luck, I'll
have some of my current projects posted soon, and this place can start to serve its purpose.
